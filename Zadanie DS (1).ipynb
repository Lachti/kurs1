Hidden layer there is no rule. Every perceptron should return 0 or 1 that way in this example output layer should hava 5 neurons. How does it work? Data is transferred to the input layer. Neurons have a weight and calculate output based on the function. Output are passed to next layer. Last layer calculates the final results. When the result is differnt from the target we start adjust the weight in every layer. "
